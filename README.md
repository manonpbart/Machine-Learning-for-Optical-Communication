# Machine Learning for Higher Order Optical Modes in Turbulence
This project uses machine learning to aid in turbulence affected optical communication and networks. This code includes simulation for generating higher order Ince, Hermite, and Laguerre Gaussian modes. 

1) Generation of higher order Ince, Hermite, and Laguerre Gaussian modes.
2) Propagation and Turbulence
3) Data-set generation
4) Generative models for spatial mode classification
5) Classifying convolutional neural networks for modes

To use:

Generation of modes:

Propagation:

Machine Learning:
The data can be generated as follows-

Run the model using-
