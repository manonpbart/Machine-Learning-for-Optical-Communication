## Introduction
This project simulates and analyzes higher-order spatial modes of light for use in turbulence-affected optical communication. The main focus is on Hermite-Gaussian (HG), Laguerre-Gaussian (LG), and Ince-Gaussian (IG) beams, their propagation, and their interaction with turbulence.

- **Hermite-Gaussian (HG) modes**  
  Defined in Cartesian coordinates with rectangular symmetry.

 where \(H_n\) are Hermite polynomials, \(\omega(z)\) is beam width, and \(\xi(z)\) is the Gouy phase.

- **Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) modes**  
  Defined in cylindrical coordinates with circular symmetry and orbital angular momentum (OAM).

  where \(L_n^{|\ell|}\) are generalized Laguerre polynomials, \(\ell\) is the azimuthal index (OAM).

- **Ince-Gaussian (IG) modes**  
  Defined in elliptical coordinates with an ellipticity parameter \(\epsilon\). They interpolate smoothly between HG and LG families.

  where \(\mathcal{C}_{p,m}^{e/o}\) are even/odd Ince polynomials and \(\epsilon\) controls ellipticity.

### Turbulence Modeling
Atmospheric turbulence is simulated using the Kolmogorov/Von Kármán model.

The turbulence strength is quantified by the structure constant \(C_n^2\):  

- **Weak turbulence**: \(C_n^2 \approx 10^{-17}\,\text{m}^{-2/3}\)  
- **Moderate turbulence**: \(C_n^2 \approx 10^{-15}\,\text{m}^{-2/3}\)  
- **Strong turbulence**: \(C_n^2 \approx 10^{-13}\,\text{m}^{-2/3}\) or higher  

A smaller inner scale (\(l_0\)) means stronger distortions, while the outer scale (\(L_0\)) sets the largest turbulence features.

### Propagation
Beam propagation is modeled with the Angular Spectrum Method (AS). This method decomposes the field into plane waves, propagates each independently, and reconstructs the beam after a chosen distance. It is efficient and well-suited for simulating free-space optical communication.

In summary, this repository lets you:
1. Generate HG, LG, and IG modes of arbitrary order.  
2. Propagate them using the Angular Spectrum Method.  
3. Add turbulence to model realistic free-space communication conditions.  
4. Build datasets for training denoising and classifying machine learning models for mode recognition and classification.
